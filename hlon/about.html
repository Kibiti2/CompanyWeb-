        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Tyres are the only part of a vehicle that makes direct contact with the road surface. They are designed to provide traction, grip, stability, and handling while also absorbing road shocks to ensure a smooth ride. Tyres are typically made of rubber and reinforced with various materials like fabric, steel, or synthetic compounds. Their design includes tread patterns to disperse water and enhance grip in different weather conditions. Proper maintenance of tyres, including regular inspection for wear and tear and maintaining optimal air pressure, is crucial for vehicle safety and performance.</p>
